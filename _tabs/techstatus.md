- The 3 outlet power strip has the monitor, the KVM, and the tower power strip plugged into it. Nothing works when this switch is off.
- The tower has the Beelink SER8 plugged in on the bottom row of plugs. At the moment the USB sockets don't seem to provide any power. I've never used them so I'm not sure if that's me or if they're broken.
- The middle row of plugs on the tower is for the Pi 5.
- I've installed Jekyll with the Chirpy theme. We'll see if it works this time on a public repo.
- terryinfcco.xyz expires in a couple of weeks, so I backed up flatnotes to the nextcloud image on the Beelink i3, and I moved the tiddlywiki instance to casaos:8081 which is on the beelink i3 in folder /home/terry/terry

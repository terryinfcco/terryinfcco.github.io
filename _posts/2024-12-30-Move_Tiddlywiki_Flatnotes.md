## What I Did Today

- terryinfcco.xyz expires in a couple of weeks and I don't plan to renew it.
- I backed up flatnotes to the nextcloud image on the Beelink i3.
- I moved the tiddlywiki instance to casaos:8081 which is on the beelink i3 in folder /home/terry/terry.
- Everything seems to work fine.
- Took the first lesson in the Dave Gray Django YouTube series. Programs are in Nextcloud/Dave_Gray_Django.

## What I Did Today

- Moved the KVM switch back to the main desk and connected the pi5 and the Beelink SER8 to it.
- The 3 outlet power strip has the monitor, the KVM, and the tower power strip plugged into it. Nothing works when this switch is off.
- The tower has the Beelink SER8 plugged in on the bottom row of plugs. At the moment the USB sockets don't seem to provide any power. I've never used them so I'm not sure if that's me or if they're broken.
- The middle row of plugs on the tower is for the Pi 5.
- I've installed Jekyll with the Chirpy theme. We'll see if it works this time on a public repo.
``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "Tech Status as of December 29, 2024"
git push
```

- Everything seems to work fine.
